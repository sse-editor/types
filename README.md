## Getting Started

This package provides the TypeScript type declarations for SSE Editor's SDKs.

> [!NOTE]
> SSE Editor's SDKs automatically include their own type definitions so typically it's not necessary to install `@sse-editor/types` separately.

### Installation

```sh
npm install @sse-editor/types --save-dev
```
